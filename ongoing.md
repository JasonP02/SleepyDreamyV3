# Ongoing
This marks what I have done, and what is to be done

## Current
Writing the GRU

## Next
Integrate GRU and encoder to get RSSM

## Future
* Continue reading the paper to build out the world model (RSSM)

## Completed
* Loaded the enviornment
* Added image and vector observations
* Created encoder pipline:
* * Takes in image, vector. 
* * Runs CNN
* * Runs MLP
* * Concatenates output to produce distribution "z"
